# Js-Boardgame-Table

**Discontinued** - Ended up on the backburner, then slid off the stove onto the ground.

Project originally intended to replicate an multiplayer online boardgame experience in a 2D space.

Technology plan:
* Fabric.js - game table object interaction
* Socket.io - real-time game table interaction
* Node.js - server
